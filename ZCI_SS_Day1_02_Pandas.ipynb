By design, `Series` recognizes three types of slicing: **boolean-based**, **integer-based** and **label-based**. Integer-based indexing means we are asking for the elements regarding their positions - i.e. integer locations - in a Series. Label-based indexing means we identify our elements by labels (or keys). Label-based indexing often takes priority, and things may get confusing when (as in our case) labels and integer locations seem interchangeable. When we used a range of integers, *Pandas* supposed that we wanted to use integer-based indexing (as we did), but when we asked for one element, *Pandas* incorrectly assumed we were asking for an entry with a specific key.

Be aware though that the fix involving the salaries might bites us in the long run; we have effectively narrowed down the distribution of salary values as well as entered potentially wrong values for these observations (which would be especially problematic if these observations have values which are in fact very far away from the median). The most important thing to remember is that handling missing values should always be performed with care and forethought, and even what the perceived best solution can still be a compromise of sorts which might effect the results of our analysis in the long run.

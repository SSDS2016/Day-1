    "Python is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language which encourages producing clean, concise, highly readable programming code. Python supports various programming paradigms - such as object-oriented, imperative, functional or procedural programming. By its nature, Python isn an interpreted language which can be used interactively (running each programming instruction separately in an interactive programming session) or by writing and running programming scripts (which may or may note be compiled in entirety before running). Python supports organizing code into \"packages\" or \"module\" which encourage modular programming and code re-use. In recent years the addition of polished, high-quality packages oriented towards data analysis have resulted in establishing the Python language as one of the leading competitors for an open, flexible data analysis platform suited for various statistical analysis, machine learning and data mining tasks."
